This is an LSTM implementation is pure go made with gorgonia.

The documentation is in progress.

By now, you can `go get github.com/owulveryck/lstm` and then run the example:

`cd example/train ; go run ../../data/tontons/input.txt`
It will train the LSTM and predict every now and then.

TODO: the Gorgonia API has changed, I may need to asjust the solver when the 0.9 will be released
